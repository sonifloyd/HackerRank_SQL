Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.





Solution

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$';


Analysis :
For this problem, we can use regular expressions to filter city names. The regular expression for city names having vowels as both 
their first and last characters is ‘^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$’. ‘^[aeiou]’ means first character is one of vowels and ‘[aeiou]$’ means the 
string ends with vowels. ‘.*’ can represent any numbers of any characters.
